This is a (growing) list of some technical software I use on my Windows machines. I'm basically only using Windows 7, so I'm not sure how good or bad these programs are on a Windows 10 setup. 

## Text Editors

- **[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download):** Great syntax-highlighting editor with lots of super helpful tools and plugins. Currently 32-bit handles plugins better than 64-bit for some reason.


- **[Atom](https://atom.io/):** A little heavy-weight and can be slow at times, but I still like how it looks. Having a folder/project view is very nice in some settings. Also, I'm not savvy enough with VIM and still prefer to click things if I need to.


- **[(g)VIM](http://www.vim.org/download.php):** If you use EMACS, you can just go pluck yourself. ;-)

## SSH/Serial Terminals

- **[RealTerm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/?source=navbar):** Awesome for dumping serial UART data to/from text files. I also really like the activity indicators.


- **[PuTTy](http://www.putty.org/):** Very basic interface, but interface with SSH, telnet, or serial (COM) ports. If you just need a simple SSH client or serial terminal emulator, this is my go-to.

## Miscellaneous

- **[TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/):** I use [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) on Windows for the actual LaTeX backend. Works on Linux as well (I use [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) instead of MikTex on Linux).

- **[Spyder (in WinPython)](https://winpython.github.io/):** Super simple install. Spyder is a little heavy/slow, but when I was newer to Python, having an IDE with linter features and an embedded console was really helpful. Also, just having an install which includes most scientific packages I'll ever need is super nice. Being a portable install always makes me happy as well.
