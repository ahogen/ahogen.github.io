Hey there! Thanks for dropping by!

As you might be able to see, there's not a lot going on over here yet, but I hope there will be soon! This is something I intend to be working on more in the future. It will be a one-stop shop where I will show of some projects I'm working on and make a couple blog posts about either those projects or random little engineering-ish things I'm up to.

Let's see how this goes!
