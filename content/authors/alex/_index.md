I write bare-metal code for microcontrollers. I also tinker with Linux and
FPGAs. On this site I share some of my personal projects and technical
discovery.

Expect to find stuff about microcontrollers like
[ARM Cortex-M0/M4/M7](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m),
[PIC32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers), or
[AVR ATtiny](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/8-bit/avr-mcus/device-selection/attiny3217).
