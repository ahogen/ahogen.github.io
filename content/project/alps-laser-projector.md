The acronym ALPS stands for Amplified Light Projection System. ALPS is
built for long-distance, high-powered alphanumeric projection applications. The
system controller rotates two separate mirrors (see Figure 1) to direct a laser
beam rapidly across any projection surface. This rotation occurs quickly enough
to create lines and shapes with the laser dot. This phenomenon is known as
[persistence of vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision)
(POV) and has been used for decades in things like flip books as a means to 
create motion pictures and animations.

### Background ###



### Features ###

ALPS has a number of key features which set it apart from other signage
systems on the market today. Some of these features are listed below.

- Visible at over 1000 feet [^A]
- Text is laser-thin so that your signage will always appear crisp and clean
- Adding custom logos and typefaces is quite simple
- Advanced, quiet cooling system ensures the hardware will never overheat

With these features, this system is sure to meet many of your long distance
signage needs, including requirements you may not know you have yet.
