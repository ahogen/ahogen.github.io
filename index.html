<h1> Alex Hogen's GitHub Page </h1>

Hey there! I'm glad you found me on GitHub! I am a 2016 graduate from Oregon Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

<br>
Currently I don't really have anything here on this page.
<br>
<br>
If you are looking for some of my coding work, I tend to update my repositories on Bitbucket more frequently. Please head on over to my Bitbucket profile to checkout recent code.
