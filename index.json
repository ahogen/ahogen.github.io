International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology 03.08 (2014): 56-63. Web. 30 Jan. 2017.\n   Note that the 2D array of partial products looks kind of like an inverted pyramid. In the case of a 4-bit multiplier, where AAAA is the multiplicand and BBBB is the multiplier, the partial product array is created like this:\n A3 A2 A1 A0 X B3 B2 B1 B0 -------------------------------------------------------------------- pp[0][3] pp[0][2] pp[0][1] pp[0][0] pp[1][3] pp[1][2] pp[1][1] pp[1][0] pp[2][3] pp[2][2] pp[2][1] pp[2][0] pp[3][3] pp[3][2] pp[3][1] pp[3][0]  But when we \u0026ldquo;flatten\u0026rdquo; the array, it looks like this:\n ^ ^ ^ pp[0][3] pp[0][2] pp[0][1] pp[0][0] | | pp[1][3] pp[1][2] pp[1][1] pp[1][0] | pp[2][3] pp[2][2] pp[2][1] pp[2][0] pp[3][3] pp[3][2] pp[3][1] pp[3][0]  pp[3][3] pp[2][3] pp[1][3] pp[0][3] pp[0][2] pp[0][1] pp[0][0] pp[3][2] pp[2][2] pp[1][2] pp[1][1] pp[1][0] pp[3][1] pp[2][1] pp[2][0] pp[3][0]  When we have an array of partial products to work with, we will group and remove the elements which will be plugged into adders. The sum and carry outputs of the adders will need to be appended to this array so that they may be used in the next level of adders.\nWe start with the uppermost adder level, which always has two adders: one half-adder and one full adder.\n Generate partial products (PPs) in inverted pyramid layout (as shown visually above) Determine how many levels of adders will be created Set current_adder_level to the total number of levels to be created Find tallest column. Call it Cm Set col_left: Cm + 1 Set col_right: Cm Create two half-adders (HAs)  Inputs for first HA are in column col_right rows 0 and 1 Inputs for second HA are in column col_left rows 0 and 1 Change second HA to \u0026ldquo;FA1\u0026rdquo; adder. This is a modified full-adder which technically has 3 inputs but one of them is set to a constant \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; due to the Baugh-Wooley multiplier scheme. Because of this constant, some logic optimizations can be made, which is why the adder will be a separate, special module instead of a regular half or full adder.   Remove the PPs just assigned to the adders from the array Flatten the array (slide the columns which now have empty elements \u0026ldquo;upwards\u0026rdquo;) Insert sum of first HA at bottom of column col_right Insert carry of first HA at bottom of column col_left Insert sum of second HA at bottom of column col_left Insert carry of second HA at bottom of column col_left + 1\u0026gt; Decrement current_adder_level  Now that the top level half-adders have been created, we can begin to generate the other full and half adders until there are only 2 levels in the partial-product (PP) array.\n While number of PP rows is \u0026gt; 2  Increment col_left Decrement col_right Create HA with inputs at row 0 and 1 of col_right Remove the points at row 0 and 1 of col_right Flatten() Insert sum of HA at bottom of col_right Insert carry of HA at bottom of col_right + 1 Set col_current: col_right While (col_current \u0026lt;= col_left)  Create FA with inputs at row 0 and 1 of col_current Remove the points at row 0 and 1 of col_current Flatten() Insert sum of FA at bottom of col_current Insert carry of FA at bottom of col_current + 1 Increment col_current   Decrement current_adder_level    ","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608757739,"objectID":"3101aaf5a542ff8f9305f758756332c3","permalink":"https://ahogen.github.io/post/building-hpm-bough-wooly-multiplier-generator/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/building-hpm-bough-wooly-multiplier-generator/","section":"post","summary":"This blog post may not make complete sense if read by itself.

You may need to hit the refresh button to see updates for the two apps we reverted back to factory versions. Tap the Update All    Now we\u0026rsquo;ll get Now Playing re-enabled.

My Nexus 5X just took a turn for the worst. After 2 years and 1 month of use, it suddenly slowed and then started bootlooping 1. And, no, I was not made aware of the class-action lawsuit. I had bought an extended damage protection plan, but that expired just a month before.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;m the market for a new phone. We\u0026rsquo;re likely 2 months away from the next Google phone, the Pixel 3, but there are some things that really bother me about this potential option.\n No 3.5mm headphone jack. A major negative for a constant audio enthusiast. Obscenely large notch. I\u0026rsquo;m paying for a very nice, high-density screen. I really dislike the idea of it being defiled by a notch. Potentially smaller battery compared to Pixel 2. Not as big a deal as the other two, but would be disappointing to get the next biggest thing and have reduced specs in a very important area.     Pixel 3 XL leaked photos   But here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s really annoying to me. The competition, from what I\u0026rsquo;ve found so far, has a lot more negatives. The biggest name seems to be Samsung.\nSamsung just released it\u0026rsquo;s Galaxy S9. But, oh look, camera under-performs in low-light conditions, battery life is inconclusive, and well\u0026hellip; Bixby 2. Also it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s got the trending notch.\nNot to mention all the garbage-ware that you can\u0026rsquo;t get rid of. I have a Samsung Tab 4 which has its own calendar, contacts, and calculator; all of which are terrible in comparison to others on the Play app store. But nope, you can\u0026rsquo;t remove them. And, in the case of calendar and contacts, both the Samsung version and the Google version sync data from my Google account. So both produce notifications and suck up data, without some tweaking. I haven\u0026rsquo;t used Samsung since, so maybe they fixed this.\nOh, and the Galaxy S9 is more expensive than the Pixel 2.\nOh, and I\u0026rsquo;ll get Android updates much less frequently than if I had a Pixel 3.\nThe hardware on some phones from OnePlus, LG, and Huawei looked interesting. However, I have a bad taste in my mouth from LG\u0026rsquo;s Nexus 5X since it bootlooped on me. The U.S. Government highly recommends not getting a Huawei phone due to spying concerns 3. OnePlus and Xiaumi are also China-based companies.\nData-mining for advertisement purposes is distasteful to me, but if there was super compelling hardware, I might not care. However, security is a concern. And in the world of Android, from what I\u0026rsquo;ve read, most people agree that you need a Google phone for faster updates.\nSo what am I to do? These slabs of silicon are not cheap. So if I\u0026rsquo;m going to drop that kind of money, I feel like I should be really happy with what I get.\nPixel 3 Pros:   Better security (faster updates)\n  Less bloatware. I want the Google apps anyway.\n  Better camera than most competition, if it\u0026rsquo;s as good or better than Pixel 2.\n  Because it\u0026rsquo;s the new flagship, should be built for the new Android Pie, and phone will be supported for a while (longer than Pixel 2, I would imagine). My Nexus 5X was going to lose support here in September 2018 I believe; just over 2 yrs after buying it.\n  If price is comparable to the Pixel 2\u0026rsquo;s $625 starting price, then it comes in a little cheaper than some of the Samsung flagship stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve read about.\n  Pixel 3 Cons:   No headphone jack. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to charge any d**n bluetooth headphones either.\n  Can\u0026rsquo;t charge phone and listen to music with wired headphones unless maybe it has wireless charging.\n  Stupidly obnoxious notch. Pay a premium to get little bits of pixels to throw away?!? Err, no. I\u0026rsquo;d rather have a fully-utilized, clean, rectagular display.\n  What would my ideal phone be?   Gets updates fast. As in, same time as Pixel phones.\n  Headphone jack\n  No notch\n  Battery lasts all day\n  Solid 12+ MP camera with good low-light performance and HDR\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t care about GPUs much since I don\u0026rsquo;t game. Just a few YouTube videos here and there.\n  SIM card.\n  Supports CDMA and GSM networks, so I can choose either with TracFone, like I did with my Nexus 5X\n  Fingerprint sensor\n  5.1\u0026rdquo; - 5.2\u0026rdquo; display \u0026ndash; I dislike large phones that won\u0026rsquo;t fit in my pockets\n  4-6GB RAM\n  32GB storage\n  I guess I\u0026rsquo;m peeved because I don\u0026rsquo;t think my ideal specs are too hard to ask for. I really actually don\u0026rsquo;t wany anything complicated. I want a good solid camera because it\u0026rsquo;s the only one I cary with me and if I see something cool, it\u0026rsquo;s important for me to have a tool to capture that moment clearly.\nI enjoy my music all the time. At work and at home, both being places where I often charge my phone as well. I want to charge the phone and play music at the same time. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t so hard to ask for in the past; I really don\u0026rsquo;t see why I should have to let that go now. And I dislike the idea of having a second battery (the wireless headphones) to charge.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read some complaints about how this new version of Android, Android Pie, is a pain to use 4. But if this really is going to be the future of Android, then I\u0026rsquo;d rather be running this on a Pixel 3, than on something else from a 3rd party who may or may not be designing the hardware to match upcoming software.\nI\u0026rsquo;m desperate for a new phone, so maybe I will just have to get a Pixel 3, because it\u0026rsquo;s the best I can do. I really did not want to settle for \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; when it comes to anything over $300. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep looking for other options until October, when the Pixel 3 is expected to be released, and see if I can find something that fits my needs better.\nIn the mean time, it\u0026rsquo;s not looking great.\nRegards,\n- an android user\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_smartphone_bootloop_issues#Nexus_5X \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.cnet.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.fastcompany.com/90218406/new-law-prohibits-government-from-using-zte-huawei-gear \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-3-xl-might-be-first-phone-google-i-just-dont-want \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1534118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608757739,"objectID":"15fa3676a441ecbba94203e7548c22eb","permalink":"https://ahogen.github.io/post/pixel-3-personal-concerns/","publishdate":"2018-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/pixel-3-personal-concerns/","section":"post","summary":"Ramblings on why I dislike the looks of the upcoming Pixel 3.\n","tags":["blog","android"],"title":"Pixel 3 Personal Concerns","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alex Hogen"],"categories":null,"content":"Looking to play an awesome open-world MMO on your open-source machine?

GW2 client downloading data file(s)   If you\u0026rsquo;ve already downloaded and installed GW2 on another machine, you can save time by using that large (~35GB) data file from the old install, in the new installation. Otherwise, the client will download this file for you.\n After the game is installed and starts downloading packages (shown above), close it. From the old/existing install find the Gw2.dat file (again, normally about 35GB). You\u0026rsquo;ll find this in the GW2 install directory, such as \u0026ldquo;C:/Program Files/Guild Wars 2/\u0026quot;. Copy that file into the new install directory, right next to the \u0026ldquo;Gw2-64.exe\u0026rdquo; file. If there is an existing Gw2.dat file which is rather small, copy over (replace) it with our larger one. It was the file being downloaded before we closed the application. Now launch GW2 (e.g. wine64 \u0026quot;/home/username/bin/Guild Wars 2/Gw2-64.exe\u0026quot;). After a few moments, and possibly downloading any updates, it should open to the login screen!  This is all I had to do to get started. However, you can improve performance a little bit by turning off debugging messages in wine. I made a launch script to do this for me.\n#!/bin/bash # https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/319.32/README/openglenvvariables.html #export LD_PRELOAD=\u0026quot;libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0026quot;; #export __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1; # Disable all Wine debug output, both to the terminal and to any log files # https://wiki.winehq.org/Debug_Channels export WINEDEBUG=-all; export LOGFILE=/dev/null; # GW2 Client cmdline args are documented here: # https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments # \u0026quot;-dx9single\u0026quot; is common for Wine # I find \u0026quot;-mapLoadInfo\u0026quot; to be kind of nice as well. wine64 \u0026quot;/home/username/bin/Guild Wars 2/Gw2-64.exe\u0026quot; -dx9single -mapLoadInfo  From here, it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to try out settings that may or may not improve performance on your system. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a gaming setup at all. Heck, the embedded graphics in my CPU uses shared RAM even. Even so, I get a solid 30 FPS. This is about 10 FPS less than running GW2 on Windows on the same machine. I find the game very playable nonetheless.\nYou may find lots of helpful info on the Guild Wars 2 Wiki pages.\n https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_on_Wine  I hope this was useful!

If you are reading this, then you are well aware of the many uses for an FFT in an FPGA.\nBackground I was going to use an FFT core for my senior project, but I had a difficult time integrating a proprietary FFT core. The User Guide for the core did not give me enough detail for me to build a proper interface. Even if I could have gotten it working, I didn\u0026rsquo;t (and still don\u0026rsquo;t) have the money to purchase a license for the core, so it would be severely limited in its functionality.\nMy senior project research taught me a lot about FFT processing in a hardware platform, which got me thinking about how I could build my own core. However, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to just make a single core for my own specific application, I wanted the functionality of generating an FFT processor of any length and bit-width. And that is how this FFT generator was born.\nFeatures  Automatically calculates twiddle factors Uses a high-performance implementation of a Baugh-Wooley multiplier  Relatively new HPM reduction tree architecture 1 Good compromise between power usage and speed Faster than conventional Baugh-Wooley multiplier 2 Faster than HPM Modified Booth multiplier 2   Length and width can be (nearly) any number Generates clean, clear SystemVerilog code  Architecture With the guidance of George Slade\u0026rsquo;s paper, along with some other internet resources, I have been working on an object-oriented, C++ library to configure and generate SystemVerilog compatible modules for use in any vendor\u0026rsquo;s FPGA.\nThe FFT core uses a custom-built multiplier.

ALPS is built for long-distance, high-powered alphanumeric projection applications. The system controller rotates two separate mirrors (see Figure 1) to direct a laser beam rapidly across any projection surface. This rotation occurs quickly enough to create lines and shapes with the laser dot. This phenomenon is known as persistence of vision (POV) and has been used for decades in things like flip books as a means to create motion pictures and animations.\nFeatures ALPS has a number of key features which set it apart from other signage systems on the market today. Some of these features are listed below.\n Visible at over 1000 feet 1 Text is laser-thin so that your signage will always appear crisp and clean Adding custom logos and typefaces is quite simple Advanced, quiet cooling system ensures the hardware will never overheat Text is entered with an IR keyboard  With these features, this system is sure to meet many of your long distance signage needs, including requirements you may not know you have yet.\nHardware Architecture Below is an overview of the hardware components used in this project:\n 100mW green laser (yes, this will burn your skin!)

That website has been removed and I migrated some of my content to this new site. I may have edited the original content for clarity.   In a college class this last year, a group of us were assigned to design a system that would collect and graph environmental data from our campus greenhouse. We would take this data, graph it, and display those graphs on a public website. We’d also use current data to control the greenhouse (i.e. watering, heating, cooling…). Hopefully this information helps you if you are wanting to start your own DIY project and automate your greenhouse.\nWe decided to use an Arduino UNO, a PICAXE-14M2, and a desktop computer running Windows Vista. The Arduino functioned as the main interface and brain. We dedicated the PICAXE to simply reading sensors and sending that data in a continuous stream to the Arduino via a serial communication protocol.\nThe Arduino would format and send data to be logged to the PC, which runs MegunoLink. The Arduino would also decide, based on environmental conditions, if the heater/cooler/water should be turned on. Future groups working on the project would have to decided whether the Arduino would do this by sending a command to a dedicated microcontroller (reverse of what we did with the PICAXE being dedicated to sensors) or by directly controlling equipment in the greenhouse.\nSo, in essence, for this project, we figured out how to set up data logging and automation of the greenhouse environment using cheap materials and open source equipment. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to build the complete working system, so our final documentation was targeted at the next group that would use our research to realize the project.\n IT Budget/Component Pricing.pdf   I\u0026rsquo;m sharing this here in case some DIY hobbyist could find the original information useful.\nNow in 2020, it might make more sense to use a Raspberry Pi as the brains, and replace the PICAXE with an Arduino for I/O interfacing. The parts may be a little more expensive, but the connectivity and control options seem a lot more flexible.\nProgramming a greenhouse controller in Python running on a network-connected Pi seems like a lot of fun. And, if you can spend a little more money, the Arduino shields for relays and sensors would simplify the wiring process!\n  Datasheets  CO2 Sensor: GE Telaire T6004 CDS-1 Hall Effect Sensor: Melexis MLX90217 Humidity Sensor: Humirel HS1101 Humidity Sensor: Parallax HS1101 Photoresistor: PerkinElmer 9800015 Temperature Sensor: TI LM34  Images             ","date":1355616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608757739,"objectID":"a224279ab9324f123ff7278235a9940c","permalink":"https://ahogen.github.io/project/greenhouse-control/","publishdate":"2012-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/greenhouse-control/","section":"project","summary":"DIY Control of your own Greenhouse","tags":["microcontroller","arduino"],"title":"Greenhouse Automation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alex Hogen"],"categories":null,"content":" This tutorial originally appeared back in 2012 on my (Alex\u0026rsquo;s) blog on Northwest Tech Experience (nwteche.com). That website has been removed and I migrated some of my content to this new site. I may have edited the original content for clarity.   Background This Christmas I put the Coby Kyros MID7012 tablet (which only runs Android 2.3.3) on my wish list. I was surprised when I actually received it! By that time, I had decided I didn’t really need it.\nThe Kyros 7012 and others don’t have the Android Market installed out of the box. It would seem like all you’d need to do is install a few .apk files and you’d be good, right? Well all but two articles I read online were not like that at all. Most required you to root the device. Although rooting itself can be undone, certain things done with rooting privileges cannot. Not to mention the fact that “rooting” the tablet most likely voids the warranty on the device. So, in short, it doesn’t seem like “doing it right the first time” is very popular with people installing the Android Market. That is why I wanted to throw in my two cents about this so that more people can do this right and not mess up their devices.\nAfter some research, I found a method that worked for me. It is based off a YouTube tutorial. If you go on YouTube, it’s the first one that pops up if you search “install android market on coby” I believe. Here’s the actual URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BrWSC2uiAg\nRelease of Liability NOTE: I, ALEXANDER HOGEN, AND ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR COMPANY ASSOCIATED WITH MYSELF SHALL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY OR ANY OTHER OUTCOME AS A RESULT OF FOLLOWING THIS TUTORIAL. THE USER RECOGNIZES THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMING THE OPERATIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS TUTORIAL AND THE USER ASSUMES FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY UNDESIRABLE OUTCOME DURING OR AFTER PERFORMING THE STEPS DESCRIBED ON THIS WEBSITE.\nI put that notification up in case someone messes up their device by following this tutorial, although I seriously doubt they will. These steps aren\u0026rsquo;t hard and there is no rooting or \u0026ldquo;jail-breaking\u0026rdquo; involved. Okay, here we go.\nInstructions   On your computer, download the “Android Market_install_files.zip” below and unzip all the files to a convenient location (say, your desktop). Android Market_install_files.zip\n  Now connect the tablet to your PC and put these files on your tablet’s SD card or internal memory. If your not sure how to do this, consult your product manual (on page 30 I think). I stuck the files in the “downloads” folder on the device itself.\n  After the files have finished transferring, disconnect the tablet from your PC.\n  Go to your file viewer app. On my tablet, they installed “ES File Explorer”. Yours should have a similar file explorer program.\n  Now find where you put those .apk files. I put mine in the “downloads” folder.\n  Ok, now you are going to install them in a specific order. (Just tap on the file to install. Hit “Done” after each one. DON’T RUN THEM AFTER THEY INSTALL!) Here is the order:\n OneTimeInitializer.apk SetupWizard.apk GoogleServicesFramework-signed.apk com.android.vending.3.3.12.apk    Ok, this step is important. DO NOT GO TO THE HOME SCREEN!!. Press and hold the power button on the tablet and turn it off.\n  Now turn it back on!\n  After start-up, you will see a menu with two options. Check the “Use this as default” box on the bottom, then select the option on top (“Launcher”). You don’t want to set up anything. You just want to use the regular initializer.\n  Make sure you are connected to a wireless network (WIFI). If not, get your tablet connected.\n  Now that your connected, go to the Apps list (by tapping the box made of little squares that’s either on the bottom or right hand side of your screen).\n  You should see the Android Market icon in this list.
